notes-
transfer learning 


The **training accuracy** shows the percentage of the images used in the current training batch that were labeled with the correct class.
**Validation accuracy**: The validation accuracy is the precision (percentage of correctly-labelled images) on a randomly-selected group of images from a different set.
**Cross entropy** is a loss function that gives a glimpse into how well the learning process is progressing. (Lower numbers are better here.)
