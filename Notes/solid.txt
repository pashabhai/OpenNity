single responsibility principle

responsibility - reason for a change

-  a class can change for only one reason .
-  reponsibilities are separated and related resposibilities are put together 
-  there are many roles, reasons for a system to change, change required for one role should not affect
other role.

keeping business login proc is bad.

responsibilities is something that we do naturally. Finding and separating those
responsibilities from one another is much of what software design is really about.
